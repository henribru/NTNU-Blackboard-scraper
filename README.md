# NTNU-Blackboard-scraper
Note: this project is not finished.

The intention behind this project is to make a script for downloading all the content I have in Blackboard, the e-learnings-system used at NTNU university in Norway.

It would be nice if you could help me finnish this project, as I have no time or knowledge to finnish this on my own within reasonable time.
As I am no programmer, i am sorry for the bad code. Sorry.
