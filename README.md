# NTNU Blackboard-scraper

This script will (hopefully) download your content stored in Blackboard, the e-learning system used at NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology

This project is not yet finnished, but I have published it as it can be used to download your files.
It would be nice if you could help me finish this project, as I have no time or knowledge to finish this on my own within reasonable time.
By the way; As I am no programmer, I am so sorry for the messy code.
